# JUnit Appium tutorial

## Prerequisites

To run your test script using JUnit with Appium, first you need to setup the environment.

1. Install JDK 1.6 or higher version
2. Latest Selenium client and it’s WebDriver Bindings.
3. Download Maven([Windows](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), [Linux](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), and [Mac](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)) or Ant. Maven supports JUnit out of the box. You would just have to define Appium dependencies in it’s project object model file or pom.xml file.
4. Optional - To test your locally or privately hosted files, you need LambdaTest Tunnel binary file.

## Steps to Run your First Test

Step 1. Clone the Junit-Appium-Sample Repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java-junit.git
```

Step 2. Inside Junit-Appium-sample folder, set the Lambda-test Credentials. You can get these from your automation dashboard.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

To help you perform cross browser testing of your locally stored web pages, LambdaTest provides an SSH(Secure Shell) tunnel connection with the name Lambda Tunnel. With Lambda Tunnel, you can test your locally hosted files before you make them live over the internet. You could even perform cross browser testing from different IP addresses belonging to various geographic locations. You can also use LambdaTest Tunnel to test web-apps and websites that are permissible inside your corporate firewall.

- Set tunnel value to True in test capabilities
  > OS specific instructions to download and setup tunnel binary can be found at the following links.
